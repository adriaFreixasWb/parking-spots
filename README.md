# 01-Car printing
We need to bulid an application that can create cars
* Red car with licence plate 1234L
* Blue car with licence plate 4567K
The application must print all created cars.

# 02-Create cars with their own feature
Let's create a class car with properties:
* Color 
* Licence plate

And use the information for the cars on step 1

# 03-Add cars to a list

A list is a collection of that of a unique type.
In our example we have a List of type car 

```
var carList = new List<Car>();
```

List have numbered positions starting for 0, there for our **first item** is carList[0] and our **second item** is carList[1].

At this exercise we are going to add our created cars from step 2 into a car collection called carList.
Once we are done cars features will be printed accessing our list by car index;
